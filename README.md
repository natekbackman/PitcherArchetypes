# PitcherArchetypes

Project worked on for the 2024 Cincinnati Reds Hackathon. Focused on grouping pitchers into archetypes based on pitcher tendencies as well as grouping pitchers based on their role in the bullpen.

# Case Requirements:

Identify characteristics of pitchers that lead to their success in specific roles, such as a traditional “starting pitcher”, a traditional “relief pitcher”, or any other pitching roles that you establish within your own analysis. 
Then, using your findings, identify some MLB pitchers who could be better off in a different role – perhaps as a starter, as a reliever, as a swingman, or as something else entirely!
Finally, provide an in-depth analysis of 2 or 3 of these players. Why might these role switches be better for them?

# Our Approach and Analysis:

We sought to cluster pitchers into groups based on: their batted ball tendencies and their plate discipline tendencies.
After that, we clustered pitchers into different bullpen roles based on their seasonal usage.
With pitchers in these clusters, we then analyzed how each pitcher class performed in different bullpen roles.
